Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

Iâ€™m a student from Nepal keen to learn about "Hybrid Cloud Multi-Cluster with Anthos". Since the quality of education in our college is not up to the mark, the only way to get a viable career option in the future for me is to take this course.Since I am a student and our college does not permit part time job, I would not be able to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. I am really excited for this course, since it presents me with a great opportunity to grow my skills and become a professional as I graduate in the same or prospective fields with a great resume. Coursera has been a great platform among my peers and following them I am very excited to take my first course here!
